# Kaleidoscope

Implementation of Kaleidoscope language in Swift.

See https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/index.html

## List of potential improvements:
- [ ] Make `Codegen.expr` switch over enum rather than types.
- [ ] Visitor pattern?
- [ ] Make compiler work over static files rather than REPL only.
- [ ] Cover with tests at least parsing part. 
    - How to cover codegen?
- [ ] Is it possible to use LLVM directly (without C wrapper) with latest Swift interop?
